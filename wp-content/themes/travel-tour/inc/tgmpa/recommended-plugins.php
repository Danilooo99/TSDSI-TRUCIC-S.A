 * Register the required plugins for this theme.
 *
 * In this example, we register five plugins:
 * - one included with the TGMPA library
 * - two from an external source, one from an arbitrary source, one from a GitHub repository
 * - two from the .org repo, where one demonstrates the use of the `is_callable` argument
 *
 * The variables passed to the `tgmpa()` function should be:
 * - an array of plugin arrays;
 * - optionally a configuration array.
 * If you are not changing anything in the configuration array, you can remove the array and remove the
 * variable from the function call: `tgmpa( $plugins );`.
 * In that case, the TGMPA default settings will be used.
 *
 * This function is hooked into `tgmpa_register`, which is fired on the WP `init` action on priority 10.
